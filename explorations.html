   <h3> Code for my game </h3>
<pre>
           def place_coin():
                coin.x = randint(20,(WIDTH - 20))
                coin.y = randint(20,(HEIGHT - 20))

           def time_up():
                global game_over
                game_over= True

           clock.schedule(time_up, 7.0)

           def update():
                global score
                if keyboard.left:
                fox.x = fox.x - 2

                elif keyboard.right:
                     fox.x = fox.x + 2

                elif keyboard.up:
                     fox.y = fox.y -2

               elif keyboard.down:
                     fox.y = fox.y + 2

               coin_collected = fox.colliderect(coin)

               if coin_collected:
                     sounds.sonic.play()
                     score = score +10
                     place_coin()
</pre>
    <p> This code shows how the coin would randomize the spawn point after its been collected
         , also how it would say game over after 7 seconds and the keys to be able to move the character 
         and the noise the coin would make after being collected it.</p>
